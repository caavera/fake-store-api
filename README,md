# Fake Store API

This is a RESTful API built with Node.js and Express. It simulates an online store with products, users, and categories, dynamically generated using Faker.js.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Node.js** and **Express** for the server.
- **@faker-js/faker** for generating fake data.
- **Joi** for data validation.
- **Boom** for error handling.
- **Helmet** for HTTP security headers.
- **Cors** to allow access from any origin.
- **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code formatting and linting.

## 🛠 Middlewares

- **Error handling with Boom.**
- **Data validation with Joi.**
- **Helmet for enhanced security.**
- **CORS support.**
- **JSON parsing with `express.json()`.**
